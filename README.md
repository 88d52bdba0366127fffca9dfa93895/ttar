# ttar

With many of compress type, I can not remember all of them, so I put all
commands to this script. You can use this script to decompress with a simple
command

**Note**: This script is based on a script of someone on the internet

## Usage

Very simple to use

```
ttar /path/to/file
```

## Install

Script install in the folder will make a soft link from `ttar` into folder
/usr/bin. If you want to delete this folder after `git clone`, you should cp
instead of ln
